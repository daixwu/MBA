许多因素导致了图中描述的现象其中两个因素分析如下。一方面,大多数毕业生选择毕业后找工作,因为他们渴望接受新的挑战,并希望将他们在学校学到的知识运用到实践中。另一方面,由于经济衰退应届毕业生很难仅凭学士学位就找到一份体面的工作。因此,越来越多的学生选择继续学术深造,以便在就业市场中享有更有利的地位。相比之下,自主创业需要大量的人力和财力资源这就解释了为什么很少有学生会做出这样的选择。

A host of factors may account for the phenomenon depicted in the chart, two of which are analyzed as follows. On the one hand, most graduates choose to find a job after graduation in that they are eager to embrace new challenges and cherish the hope to apply what they have learned at school to practice. On the other hand, due to economic recession, it is quite difficult for fresh graduates to find a decent job with merely a bachelor's degree As a result, an
increasing number of students choose to further their academic studies in order to enjoy a more favorable position in the job market. By contrast, starting one s own businesses requires a considerable amount of human and financial sources which explains why few stu dents make such a choice.

显然,这样一种现象的出现是由多种因素造成的,从我的观点来看,以下两种因素最为重要。首先,经济发展在一定程度上对形势施以影响。随着越来越多的人享受更好的生活水平,价格已经不再是他们在餐厅用餐时最关心的问题。另一个同样至关重要并且值得一提的因素是人们对生活态度的转变。根据最近公布的一份官方报告,现如今越来越多的人倾向于尝试新奇的体验,这就解释了为什么一家餐厅的特色对很多人来说如此重要。

Apparently, a host of factors are responsible for the emergence of such a phenomenon; from my standpoint, the following two are the most essential ones. Firstly, economic development has, to some extent, exerted an impact on the situation. As more and more people currently enjoy better living standards, price is no longer their primary concern when dining in a restaurant. Another equally vital element worth mentioning is the shift of people' s attitudes towards life. According to an official report released recently, people in increasing number nowadays are inclined to try novel experience, which explains why the specialty of a restaurant is so important to many people.

至少有两个基本原因可以解释这一现象。首先,人们普遍承认,随着整个社会气候的飞速发展,人们的生活水平得到了显著提高。这一普遍现象导致了越来越多的人们能够负担得起曾经被认为昂贵的生活体验。此外不可否认的是,有关当局已经推出了一系列的优惠政策,以保护和促进文化产业的发展,来吸引更多的游客。

At least two fundamental factors could be identified to contribute to this phenomenon. To begin with, it is widely admitted that with the rapid economic development in the whole social climate has been the dramatically upgraded living standard, which results in the common phenomenon that people in growing numbers can afford the once-deemed-expensive experience In addition, there is no denying that the authorities concerned have issued a series of preferential policies to protect and promote the development of cultural industry, which encourages a widespread extension of visitors.

亳无疑问,该图显示出大部分大学生旅游是为了放松和娱乐。首先经济发展带来的富裕使得旅行成为可以被承受起的消费项目。其次,由于快节奏的校园生活,象牙塔中的竞争越来越激烈,也给学生们带来了巨大的压力。在这种情况下,许多人选择旅游来放松自己,这也可以使学生们摆脱学习的负担。

Undoubtedly, this graph demonstrates that most college students travel to pursue relaxation and happiness. In the first place, great affluence as a result of rapid economic growth has rendered traveling readily affordable. In addition, on account of the quickening pace of campus life, competition increasingly intensifies in the Ivory Tower, which imposes tremendous pressure on college students. Under such circumstances, many choose traveling as a way to refresh and relax themselves, which can free the students from the burden of study.

想出一些可能的因素来解释这个趋势对我们来说并不困难。一方面近年来,随着经济和社会的快速增长,越来越多的人涌入城市寻找就业机会、感受体面的生活以及寻求城市生活的刺激感。另一方面,农村地区经济相对不发达,赚钱和追寻未来的机会也比较少。因此,越来越多的人蜂拥而至城市,试图通过这种方式来摆脱这种命运。

It is not difficult for us to come up with some possible factors accounting for this trend, On the one hand, with the rapid development of economy and society, people in mounting numbers crowd into cities in search of employment, a decent living and the excitement of urban life recently On the other hand, the economy in the rural districts is comparative less developed and thus the opportunity to make money and pursue their future is as well lean. As a result, an increasing number of folks are trying to escape this destiny by flocking into the urban areas.
